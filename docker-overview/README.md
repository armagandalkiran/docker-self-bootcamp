# What is Docker ?

## Docker Ecosystem

- Docker Client
- Docker Server
- Docker Machine
- Docker Images
- Docker Hub
- Docker Compose

So, Docker is a platform or ecosystem around creating and running containers.

Image: Single file with all the deps and config required to run a program.

Container: Instance of an image. Runs a program. Container is a program with it's own isolated set of hardware resources. ( memory, network tech, hard drive )
